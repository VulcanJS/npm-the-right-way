# NPM Packages - The Right way

This repository aims to demonstrate how to build NPM packages the right way.

- `my-package` should import the shared code, built for the current environment.
- `my-package/server` should import the server-only code (and maybe shared code as well?)
- `my-package/client` should import the client-only code (and maybe shared code as well?)
- Packages should be written in TypeScript and expose their type definitions

Bonus features:

- Folders may have multiple indexes `index.client.ts`, `index.server.ts` etc.
- Support common 3rd party tools: importing in Jest, Storybook, Cypress...

To sum it up, we want to demonstrate how to build fullstack, typed NPM packages.

We take inspiration from Meteor package system: https://guide.meteor.com/writing-atmosphere-packages.html.
They provide an incredible developer experience, but were sadly limited to Meteor apps and suffer from a few technical issues.
We want to achieve the same "DevX" with modern, generic bundlers.


Note: the shared code will be exactly the same in both environment, this is slightly different to what we call isomorphism.
Isomorphism is only possible with some magic at import time (basically changing `my-package` to `my-package/<current-environment>` at build time in your app), which is out of scope here.

## Run and test

- Clone this repo
- `yarn` - Install relevant packages
- `cd my-package-webpack && yarn && yarn run publish` - Will build your package + generate a tarball
- `cd .. && cd demo-next-app && yarn && yarn run dev` - Will start a Next.js app that imports each package
- Open relevant page to test the import

## How you can help

See contribute section below.

You can:

- add a demo with a new bundler: Rollup, ~~Tsup (https://github.com/egoist/tsup)~~ (done :), Unbuild (https://github.com/unjs/unbuild) could be great candidates.
- exploring TSDX (https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx): how could contribute to this project, which ideas we could test here
- improve the build for one of the bundler we cover
- add automated tests for the Next.js app, using Jest or Cypress
- open an issue with ideas, feedback, knowledge about bundlers, a feature you'd like to test etc. etc.
- add a performance benchmark
- automate building, facilitate development

## Learnings - various

### Formats

- UMD used to be the way to go for having a single shared bundle, but now ES Modules should be preferred.
Moderne bundlers such as Esbuild might not support them: https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/507
- In Webpack, `commonjs2` seems to do something similar to UMD
- ES Modules will be the reference in the short run

### NPM packages

- NPM exports will be the reference in the short run, but:
  - need better support in TypeScript
  - need better support in Jest, should be shipped in Jest 28: https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/9771

### TypeScript

- TypeScript doesn't support multi entry exports correctly at the time of writing, see this article for a hackish (but brilliant) solution to bypass this issue: https://blog.mozilla.org/data/2021/04/07/this-week-in-glean-publishing-glean-js/, see Stack Overflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63058081/package-json-with-multiple-entrypoints
- For all bundlers that do not support generating `.d.ts`, you can simply use `"tsc --emitDeclarationOnly --declaration` to generate the type definitions. Generating such files needs TypeScript, it's not yet possible to create them more quickly without rewriting TypeScript. They will account for most of the build time when using Esbuild or SWC, half of the build-time (very roughly, can vary) for a Webpack project.
- You must not alter the file names when building, otherwise your definition files won't match. See https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#outputlibrarytype
- There is an issue between `@types/node` and TS 4.5, we locked it to 4.2 in the Esbuild demo: @see https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/55430
- TS will transpile dynamic import, leading to `Module not found: ESM packages (my-package-esbuild/client) need to be imported. Use 'import'`. You need to prevent it from doing so: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65265420/how-to-prevent-typescript-from-transpiling-dynamic-imports-into-require
In Next.js, the issue can be bypassed by definining an intermdiate client-only, using top level `import`, and then dynamically importing only the local component.
- It might explain https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68423950/when-using-esbuild-with-external-react-i-get-dynamic-require-of-react-is-not-s?rq=1
- In the future, TSC might be rewritten in Go by the developper behind SWC (announced in January 2020 https://twitter.com/kdy1dev/status/1484764829097201667), bringing crazy performances

### Esmodules

- They are more appropriate for packages as "IIFE", because packages might be imported within an app that will in turn be built. ES modules will give more freedom to the app bundler, while in an NPM package we want to minimize the build step. See https://esbuild.github.io/api/#format
- Setting "type":"module" in package.json will apply to **all exports with .js extension**! So if you use CommonJS exports for Node + ESM for browser the Node imports will break. This applies to conditional exports too. Instead, **make sure that CommonJS file are using .cjs extension!**
- Exporting Node to ES modules is a bad idea. Instead use conditionnal exports, and CommonJS for node code.
- **CommonJS exports must end with .cjs and ES Modules with .mjs!** ".js" alone is ambiguous! Its behaviour changes depending on the `type: "module"` option of package.json, leading to confusing behaviour.

### TSDX

TSDX is a brillant project that helps bootstrapping NPM package development

- It includes dev vs prod bundle with a loading based on the current NODE_ENV => very interesting pattern, that we could use here
- It includes a nice support for Lodash
- It is based on top of Rollup for the build
- Limitations: it doesn't demo a monorepo and doesn't demo fullstack packages, but could probably be extended to do so
  
### Others

- Typing the bundler config is often difficult, because they are run at low-level, using Node.
The `@types` directive in comments might help having IntelliSense in VS code, without actually using TypeScript files.
- Don't forget to drop `.next` from time to time when working with local packages. Next.js might cache them,
leading to stale imports
- NPM and/or Yarn may cache .tgz files in an unexpected way, reinstalling a stale version everytime:https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6811

### Next.js app

- In v12.1, I hit following bug:https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/35112 with "type":"module". It seems that the CJS code might in some case try to load the ESM exports of its submodule, instead of sticking to CJS.


## Learning - per build tools


### Webpack

- Works ok, but slow
- Webpack has a weird way to handle packages in Lerna repo, the bundle sometimes end up containing the current package + imports: https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/3006

At the moment this repo doesn't demo importing other packages, or monorepo, but it could useful in the future.

### Esbuild

- Handling external is utterly painful for the server export! You want to add packages such as React, Graphql etc. as "externals" but there
  is no easy way to add all packages from package.json as externals
- The demo works, but it may still generate `const React = require('React')` in the ESM build in some real-life context, while "require" should never
appear in an ESM module

### Tsup

- Tsup is an abstraction over Esbuild. It sounds more relevant for people that build packages (treating node modules as externals ; generating .d.ts etc.)
- Supports .d.ts generation but probably not `.d.ts.map` which are needed for local development (switching to types in VS code) => it might still be necessary to use `tsc` during dev
- Changing the kind of built file might change the extensions, be careful with that (sometimes .js is the commonJS, sometimes the ES modules).
**This may lead to the following confusing behaviour:**: when using `cjs` and `esm` as the the output, `.js` will be the `CommonJS` export, and `.mjs` the ES module export. If you add `type: module` to your package.json, the CommonJS `.js` export will actually be considered as an ES Module!
Conditional exports are supposed to avoid this issue (you don't need to use `type:"module"` with them) but may not work
 
### Unbuild

- Doesn't respect the "outDir" in our demo
- Based on rollup, at the time of writing there is no official doc for the config, but you can write in TypeScript and read the source directly: https://github.com/unjs/unbuild/blob/main/src/types.ts



## Contribute

- If you want to test a new bundler, copy `package-template` and setup `package.json` accordingly.
Please try to modify only the `package.json`: this way we can compare bundlers against the same basic features.

- Then add a new page in the Next.js demo app.

- To update a package, run `yarn run publish` to build and pack it, and rerun `yarn` in the Next.js app. 
You may need to use `npm` if the package is not updated, see https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6811, for example `npm i my-package-webpack`.
This is because of a bug in Yarn relative to local packages when using tarballs and relative paths.

- You may use this package to reproduce bugs for certain bundlers. 
In this case, reproduce your bug, and open a pull request. We'll keep it open until the maintainers of the bundler fix the bug.

- If you want to test a new feature (exporting React components, supporting path aliases or whatever),
you may open a PR modifying the "package-template". We can then apply this change to all the packages using a command in the future, or apply it manually.
